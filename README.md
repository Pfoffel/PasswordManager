# PasswordManager
 A programm that is able to store your passwords of differernt websites, generate strong passwords and in the future hopefully autocomplete them in browsers.
 I also want to implement a option to save your creditcard information and so on.
 I would also like to turn it into a application. Not just a console based programm.

 I have set the MasterPassword to 12345678 for testing purposes
